\page example-stencil-type-inference Infering operator types

# Goal
Illustrate how to obtain stencil operator types.


# Key Concepts

 -# There are a number of predefined operators/stencils in SpatialOps. They
    can be obtained via two simple ways:
    - The simplest way to obtain these is via the \link SpatialOps::BasicOpTypes
      BasicOpTypes\endlink struct.  This requires the volume field type and
      provides the types of all operators associated with that field.
    - Alternatively, one can use the \link SpatialOps::OperatorTypeBuilder
      OperatorTypeBuilder \endlink struct, which provides a bit more flexibility
      but requires more type knowledge.

    These approaches are both illustrated in the example below.

 -# Each stencil defines the type of field that it consumes (the source field)
    as well as the type of field it produces (the destination field) as follows:
    \code{.cpp}
     typedef OpType::SrcFieldType  SrcType;
     typedef OpType::DestFieldType DestType;
    \endcode

 -# Because of this strong typing and type inference, SpatialOps can guarantee,
    at compile time, compatibility between fields and operators.

    create a very generic 3D Laplacian function.
