/**
 \example Example7_stencils.cpp

# Goal
Illustrate how to use stencil operators within SpatialOps/Nebo

# Key Concepts
 -# There are a number of predefined operators/stencils in SpatialOps.  The 
    simplest way to obtain these is via the \link SpatialOps::BasicOpTypes
    BasicOpTypes\endlink struct. Much of this was covered in \ref Example5_stencil_type_inference.cpp
 -# Stencils can be stored and retrieved in the \link SpatialOps::OperatorDatabase
    OperatorDatabase\endlink which provides simple storage and retrieval of
    operators by type.
 -# SpatialOps defines many stencils for use on structured, finite-volume meshes.
    The build_stencils function can be used to easily populate an OperatorDatabase
    with the predefined operators in SpatialOps.
