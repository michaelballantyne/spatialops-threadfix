/**
 * \example Example1_field_creation.cpp  Basics of field creation.
 *
 * # Goal of this example
 * This example will show how to create a field in SpatialOps
 *
 * # Key Concepts
 *
 *  -# A \link SpatialOps::structured::SpatialField SpatialField \endlink is
 * comprised of a few things:
 *   - A \link SpatialOps::structured::MemoryWindow MemoryWindow \endlink to
 *     describe the logical layout of the field in memory
 *   - A \link SpatialOps::structured::BoundaryCellInfo BoundaryCellInfo \endlink
 *     object to describe the behavior of a field at a boundary
 *   - The raw block of memory for the field
 *   - The location of the field (CPU, GPU, etc.)
 *
 *  -# A \link SpatialOps::structured::SpatialField SpatialField \endlink is
 *   strongly typed.  There are several supported field types defined for fields
 *   associated with structured meshes listed \link fieldtypes here\endlink.
 *  
 *  -# For face fields on structured meshes, the (+) face on the (+) side of the
 *     domain has an extra storage location.  The
 *     \link SpatialOps::structured::BoundaryCellInfo BoundaryCellInfo \endlink
 *     object encodes this information.
