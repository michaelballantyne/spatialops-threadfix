# Goals
 - Illustrate how to use stencil operators
 - Illustrate type inference from fields to operators

# Key Concepts
 -# There are a number of predefined operators/stencils in SpatialOps.  The 
    simplest way to obtain these is via the \link SpatialOps::BasicOpTypes
    BasicOpTypes\endlink struct.
 -# Stencils can be stored and retrieved in the \link SpatialOps::OperatorDatabase
    OperatorDatabase\endlink which provides simple storage and retrieval of
    operators by type.
 -# Using type inference, highly generic code can be written that is also very
    robust.
