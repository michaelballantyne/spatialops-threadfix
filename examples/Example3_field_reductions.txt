/**

\example Example3_field_reductions.cpp  Operations using fields.

# Goal of this example
This example will show how to use SpatialFields in SpatialOps to perform
reduction operations (norm, max, min) on field

# Key Concepts

 -# Nebo supports reduction operations on fields.
 -# Currently, field reductions only have support for CPU fields.
 -# This example also illustrates the different layouts of fields.
