/**
\example Example_field_type_inference.cpp  Inferring field types.

# Goal of this example
 This example will show how to obtain related field types from an existing field
 or operator type.  This is very useful for finite volume calculations where
 we want to obtain the type of x-face field given a volume field type, for example.

# Key Concepts
 -# While new field types can be added to SpatialOps, a list of commonly used
    field types is provided in FVStaggeredFieldTypes.h.  See also the \ref fieldtypes module.
 -# To obtain the face types associated with a volume field type, use
    \link SpatialOps::FaceTypes FaceTypes \endlink
    \code{.cpp}
     typedef FaceTypes<VolT>::XFace XFaceT;
     typedef FaceTypes<VolT>::YFace YFaceT;
     typedef FaceTypes<VolT>::ZFace ZFaceT;
    \endcode
 -# To obtain the volume field type associated with a given face type, use
    \link SpatialOps::VolType VolType \endlink
    \code{.cpp}
     typedef VolType<FaceT>::VolField VolT;
    \endcode
 -# Operator types can be used to infer field types: 
   \code{.cpp}
    typedef OpType::SrcFieldT  SrcT;  // the type of field that OpType acts on
    typedef OpType::DestFieldT DestT; // the type of field that OpType produces
   \endcode
