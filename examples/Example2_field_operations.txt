/**

\example Example2_field_operations.cpp  Operations using fields.

# Goal of this example
This example will show how to use SpatialFields in SpatialOps to perform a 
variety of field operations.

# Key Concepts

 -# Most mathematical operations/functions are supported in Nebo's field 
    operations.  They are lifted over fields.  This includes standard mathematical
    operations such as \c sin \c cos \c exp, etc.
    
 -# Nebo supports a variety of Field Reduction operations including \c min \c max, \c norm, etc.
   
 -# Nebo supports conditional operations that unroll to the equivalent of point-wise
    \c if statements.  These are achieved via the \c cond construct:
    \code
    f <<= cond( condition1, result1 )
              ( condition2, result2 )
              ...
              ( default_result );
    \endcode
    which is equivalent to
    \code
    for i
      if     ( condition1 ) f[i] = result1[i];
      else if( condition2 ) f[i] = result2[i];
      ...
      else                  f[i] = default_result[i]; 
    end
    \endcode
    Note that the \c result1 \c result2 etc. may be expressions themselves, fields,
    or scalar values.
