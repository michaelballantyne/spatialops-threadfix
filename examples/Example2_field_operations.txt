/**

\example Example2_field_operations.cpp  Operations using fields.

# Goal of this example
This example will show how to use SpatialFields in SpatialOps to perform a 
variety of field operations.

# Key Concepts

 -# Most mathematical operations/functions are supported in Nebo's 
    \link NeboOperators field operations \endlink.  They are lifted over fields.
    This includes standard mathematical
    operations such as \c sin \c cos \c exp, etc.
    
 -# Nebo supports conditional operations that unroll to the equivalent of point-wise
    \c if statements.  These are achieved via the \link NeboCond nebo cond\endlink
    construct.
