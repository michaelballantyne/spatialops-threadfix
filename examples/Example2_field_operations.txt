/**

\example Example2_field_operations.cpp  Operations using fields.

# Goal of this example
This example will show how to use SpatialFields in SpatialOps to perform a 
variety of field operations.

# Key Concepts

 -# Most mathematical operations/functions are supported in Nebo's 
    \link NeboOperators field operations \endlink.  They are lifted over fields.
    This includes standard mathematical
    operations such as \c sin \c cos \c exp, etc.
    
 -# Nebo supports conditional operations that unroll to the equivalent of point-wise
    \c if statements.  These are achieved via the \link NeboCond nebo cond \endlink
    construct.

 -# For fields with CPU-allocated memory, \link SpatialOps::print_field print_field \endlink will
    write the field with some formatting to the given output stream. Note that print_field
    prints the lowest index first and ends with the highest index.

# Try This
 -# Create a function `sin(x)` and then clip its values to be within [-0.1,0.2].

# Example Code
